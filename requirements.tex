\section{Review: System Requirements}

In this section we shall review the provided requirements calling attention to mistakes and vaguenesses in the requirements, which we recognise as defects. As well as identifying them, we shall delineate any assumptions we are forced to make due to missing or imprecise requirements. 

% Type of Req Document? Informal? 
% -------------------------------
It is not evident at the outset the type of specification document these requirements were extracted from; if a more complete document is available, such as an IEEE SRS, then we would kindly request access to it as it should help in filling the voids left by the current extact.  
This step is critical before proceeding with the test process as testing based on false or incomplete understanding risks generating lots of false-positive or worse false-negatives, and would be costly both in terms of time and money. 
\par

% -------------------------------------------------
% Requirements organisation (bullets, no numbering)
% -------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements organisation}
The requirements are bulletized, a numbering scheme would be much more apt as it allows testers and reviewers of the document the ability to reference individual requirements using their identifier. In some organisation, test methods or classes are prefixed with the requirement reference they address. 

We will take it on ourselves to label the requirements for our own workflow (see Appendix \ref{appendix:labelled-requirements}) and we propose that any additions or alterations to be made on the requirements be done on that table.

% TODO: Some SRS documents will capitalise SHOULD, MUST, MAY to leave no room for confusion. 

% --------------------------------------------------
% Requirements doc lacks of coherence 
% which lends to an overall lack of professionalism
% --------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements coherence}
At first read, a lack of coherence in the structure and wording of the requirements is clear, depicting an overall lack of formality and professionalism in the software engineering process. 
A positive consequence of this, perhaps surprisingly, is that it puts the tester on the alert for what to expect of the quality of the software to be tested, making them question the meticulousness of the project managers and in turn the developers.
\par
Below we outline some of the observed incoherences. They are not catastrophic by any means and need not be raised as defects, but are still worth raising:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The 1st bullet in the list (\textit{"The PTMA must implement a Personal Tax Management System to meet the following requirements."}) is not an explicit requirement, but an introductory sentence which should not have been bulletised. This is misleading to the reader seein as most other bullets are requirements. 
	\item The 7th bullet in the list (\textit{"The system must include a simple ‘help’ system that lists all commands"}) does not terminate with a full stop while the rest do. 
	\item The bullet detailing the taxing of divorced people (R8.7) does not capitalise the word "divorced", but does capitalise "Single" and "Married". The reader will attempt their best not to take this as a lack of respect for divorced individuals. 
	% in the When outlining marital status taxing, we can see "Calculation of tax for Married people", "Calculation of tax for Single people", but the word 'divorced' is not capitalised, typo or lack of respect for divorced?  
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------------------------
% Non-Functional Requirements
% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
It is understood that performance testing, security and other non-functional requirements are not to be considered in the scope of testing this project; however, it would be careless for us not to mention them in a System Requirments review as they constitute an intrical part of the requirements development process. 
We would normally expect requirements on security, performance, compatibility and robustness to be elicited clearly in a separate non-functional requirements section; but, it is understood that the scope of testing of this project is restricted to the functional aspects and this may explain their absence. 
\par
That said, we identify (R7: \textit{"The system must not crash if the user enters something that they are not meant to."}) as a non-functional requirement pertaining to the robustness of the application. In a more formal document, this requirement should be placed separately to functional ones.    
%
% Ignorable: 
% ----------
% What platforms must the system run on? Must the language to be used be Java, or can developer preference overtake in the matter? 
% * Non-functional requirements have not been detailed: do we expect the system to run on any platform? are there any speed / performance requirements that need to be catered for? For example, the requirements don't mention how many clients can be persisted on the app, which may imply (unlimited), but in such a case, it would be useful to reconsider the array design, as this does not provide enough flexibility going forward. 
% * Are there no security requirements? Perhaps the ability to allow locking the app with an app is desirable? After all, the software does hold people's tax codes, rates...
\par

% ----------------------------------------------
% Key term definitions
% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Key term definitions}
The requirements are missing some of the key sections required by an SRS document.
For instance, we note the absence of a "Definitions" section outlining the meaning to be understood from the key terms used in the requirements.
It would be useful to point out that terms "will", "should", "must", and "may" conform to a predefined standard definition (e.g. IEEE Std 610.12-1990) in order to ascertain their priorities relative to each other and avoid confusion in their interpretation. 
The importance of this should not be understated seeing as it is quite likely the audience span of this document will include non-native english speakers. 

Further to this, we request explicitly defining the below key words which  appear to have been used interchangeably:  

\begin{itemize} 
	\item Client, customer and person. Client is used in requirements (R1, R2, R5), customer in (R2, R3, R4, R5) and person in all (R8) requirements.  R5 interchangeably employs customer and client in the same sentence. 
	\item System and application. System is used in (R2, R6, R7) while application is used in (R1, R4, R5).
\end{itemize}

We assume through contextual understanding that they refer to the same entity, however we do request this be confirmed to us in a "Definitions" section preferably in a more formal document.

\par

% It is good that the present requirements limit the key terms used to a subset of well-known ones (will, may, should, must) are used. This reduces the risk of vagueness emanating from (english understanding).

% DEFECTS and VAGUENESS in requirements 
% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Defects and Vaguenesses}

In this section we address imprecise requirements and what we believe to be defects in the requirements. The provided requirements have been labelled (see Appendix \ref{appendix:labelled-requirements}) to improve readability and accessibility of the report. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [1]
\subsubsection{R1 - The application must enable the storage of client’s personal details including. }

There is a lack of specificity on what storage means here. Does it refer to persistent storage? In which, case a form of database on disk would be required, or is it sufficient for it to be stored in memory during application runtime? The latter would not offer persistent for if the application or machine crashed.  

If persistent storage is to be used, it would be useful for the requirements to ouline the requirements on such database, are there non-function requirements such as performance metrics that the database should respect? 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [2]
\subsubsection{R2 - The software should issue each customer a numeric identifier [...]} % which must be unique to that client and never be used by a different client (that is, if a client is deleted from the system then their ID should not be used again but has to die with them). }

This requirement is relatively more detailed than some of the others, given it is accompanied by an example detailing a scenario and how the application should behave with respect to that scenario. 

While 'die' is quoted, it is still an aggressive term to use in a requirement. 'Expire' is a reasonable alternative term, but we won't pedantize on this as there are more critical defects and ambiguities in the requirements to address.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [3]
\subsubsection{R3 - The PTMA should enable customer details to be updated.}

This requirement can be further expanded on, especially considering that it relates to significant chunks of the code. 
What details can a user update? Should it be allowed to update a customer's account number (ID)?
Is it required that there be a separate menu command for updating each of the following: first name, last name, tax code ? What about salary? Was this a desirable or required feature?    

% requiremrents lacking more explanation (e.g. 3)
% no expanding on how the update process should be. It seems that we want to allow the flexibility to update either of the customer's fields directly with its own command, but this does not link back to an evident requirement from the bulletised list. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [4]
\subsubsection{R4 - The application should be able to print lists of customer information [...]} % with users being able to select blocks of customers to be printed based on their unique identifiers.}

This requirements weakness only becomes evident when the application is tested and it becomes apparent that the Unique Identifiers generated for the created customers are never presented to the the application user for them to take note of. 

This requirement can further do with specificity to what type of block can be selected in the list to print. 
Should it be possible to use a comma-separated list of blocks to print out? This approach is not uncommon in other computer applications (e.g. specifying the list of pages to print on modern OSes is possible with "2-10,15-35"). This requirement could do with more specificity to the pages format. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [5]
\subsubsection{R5 - The application will calculate the tax amount to be paid by each client [...]} % and display this amount along with the other customer details. The amount of the tax is based on their taxcode and their current salary according to the rules below.}

This requirement is reasonably understandable. It is not however clear why it was separeted from the tax rules, seems like they could have been structured to follow each other. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [6]
\subsubsection{R6 - The system must include a simple 'help' system that lists all commands.}
Assuming system refers to application, there's no ambiguity in the functionality requested in this requirement. 

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% [7]
\subsubsection{R7 - The system must not crash if the user enters something that they are not meant to.}
Assuming system refers to the application, the requirement is clear. This requirement relates to the application's robustness and should, in a more formal document, be placed in the non-functional requirements section along with other requirements relating to performance, robustness, security.

\input{requirements-r8}

% \subsubsection{R8 - Tax Rules}
% [ Thus, for clarity, both of the following tax codes are valid. ] 
% It would be extra helpful to provide a tax code that should not be accepted (e.g. 1080MT90). In fairness the provided examples were appreciated as they helped clarify the requriement.

% % The alphabetic portion of the code may consist of multiple letters drawn from the following set, with their corresponding meanings:
% The requirement does not explicitly elicit the fact that the different letters pertaning to marital status are mutually exclusive. Similarly, it does not do this for education and number of children. 

% The requirements do not specify there must be a letter from the marital status in the tax code. Intuitively, an individual must be in one of those sections hence the tax code MUST have a letter from the marital status. This is not specified in the requirement but was assumed during testing. 

% The requirement does not specify the application's behaviour for the case when duplicates of the same letter are found in the tax code. We would expect the tax code parser to complain and specify this as invalid, however others may interpret "DD1000" to be apply the Divorced taxing twice. 

% % common to all next sections: 

% The statement: "Married people with a current salary less than £12,000 will pay a tax rate of 90\% of their base tax amount."

% alone, implies that someone earning £4,000 must pay a rate of 90\%. This is not true, in the case of this application given the other statement: "Married people with a current salary of less than £5000 will pay a tax rate of 70\% of their base tax amount.". 

% We assume the intention is to say: 

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item People earning between [0-5000[ should pay 70\% tax rate 
% 	\item People earning between [5000-12000] should pay 90\%
% \end{itemize}

% The requirements are not as well expressed here. 

% % 8 - Married section 
% The requirements for taxing Married people do not cover those who earn exactly £27,000. The third bullet ("less than") implies they are excluded from the 120\% tax rate, and the bullet right after ("above than") excludes them as well. 

% % 8 - Single section 
% Third bullet possibly mistyped. If it is not, then the third and fourth bullets are contradictory. We assume the intention was to say:  

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item People earning in bracket [11k-22k[ pay a rate of 125\%
% 	\item People earning 22k and above pay rate 132\%
% \end{itemize}

% If third bullet is adjusted to say "less than" instead of above, then this fixes the contradiction, but still leaves this requirement not covering the case where the taxee earns £22,000 exactly (same as Married section). 

% % 8 - Divorced 
% Same as single section. 

% The following salaries / tax codes are not covered by the requirements: 
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Married and earning £27,000
% 	\item Single and earning £22,000 (if other typo is fixed)* (see Single Section)
% 	\item Divorced and earning £24,000 (if other typo is fixed) *(see Divorced Section)
% 	\item Single Child and earning £10,400
% 	\item Two children and earning £9900
% 	\item More than 2 children and earning £9000
% 	\item FT education below 24yo and earning £3000
% 	\item FT education 24yo and above earning £3000
% \end{itemize}

% --------------------------------------
% MISSING REQUIREMENTS ? 
% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Missing requirements}

% showing the ID of created clients 
Requirement 4 points to the need to allow users to see customers based on their IDs, but there is no reference to how the application-generated IDs are presented to the user. This was found to be an issue during exploratory testing, and was sourced back to both a defect in the implementation and absence in the requirements. 

% no requirement to delete clients. 
There is no requirement about the user's ability to delete customers from storage. This is tacitly mentioned as part of the second requirements relating to ID uniqueness. We believe it is then an oversight on the requirements writers. 

% Edge case
Is it implicity that negative salaries are not a thing? How does the code deal with that? 

% --------------------------------------
% Assumptions
% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Assumptions}

%TODO: say we will attempt to recap on some of the assumptions made in reading the requirements; then search for "assume" in the above and list all things in bullets. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item We assume that earning less than zero (Paying?) person, pays no tax. i.e. min range = 0. 
\end{itemize}
