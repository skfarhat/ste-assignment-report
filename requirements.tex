\section{Review: System Requirements}

In this section we shall review the provided requirements calling attention to mistakes and vaguenesses in the requirements, which we recognise as defects. As well as identifying them, we shall delineate any assumptions we are forced to make due to missing or imprecise requirements. 

% Type of Req Document? Informal? 
% -------------------------------
It is not evident at the outset the type of specification document these requirements were extracted from; if a more complete document is available, such as an IEEE SRS, then we would kindly request access to it as it should help in filling the voids left by the current extact.  
This step is critical before proceeding with the test process as testing based on false or incomplete understanding risks generating lots of false-positive or worse false-negatives, and would be costly both in terms of time and money. 
\par

% -------------------------------------------------
% Requirements organisation (bullets, no numbering)
% -------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements organisation}
The requirements are bulletised, a numbering scheme would be much more apt as it allows testers and reviewers of the document the ability to reference individual requirements using their identifier. In some organisation, test methods or classes are prefixed with the requirement reference they address. 

We will take it on ourselves to label the requirements for our own workflow (see Appendix \ref{app:labelled-requirements}) and we propose that any additions or alterations to be made on the requirements be done on that table.

% TODO: Some SRS documents will capitalise SHOULD, MUST, MAY to leave no room for confusion. 

% --------------------------------------------------
% Requirements doc lacks of coherence 
% which lends to an overall lack of professionalism
% --------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Requirements coherence}
At first read, a lack of coherence in the structure and wording of the requirements is clear, depicting an overall lack of formality and professionalism in the software engineering process. 
A positive consequence of this, perhaps surprisingly, is that it puts the tester on the alert for what to expect of the quality of the software to be tested, making them question the meticulousness of the project managers and in turn the developers.
\par
Below we outline some of the observed incoherences. They are not catastrophic by any means and need not be raised as defects, but are still worth raising:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \nth{1} bullet in the list (\textit{"The PTMA must implement a Personal Tax Management System to meet the following requirements."}) is not an explicit requirement, but an introductory sentence which should not have been bulletised. This is misleading to the reader seein as most other bullets are requirements. 
	\item The \nth{7} bullet in the list (\textit{"The system must include a simple ‘help’ system that lists all commands"}) does not terminate with a full stop while the rest do. 
	\item Requirements (\REightFive to \REightTen) all begin with \textit{Calculation of tax for people}, whereas the last two requirements (\REightEleven to \REightTwelve) begin with \textit{Calculation for people}. It is not clear why there is a distinction in the wording of these requirements. 
	\item The bullet detailing the taxing of divorced people (\REightSeven) does not capitalise the word "divorced", but does capitalise "Single" and "Married". The reader will attempt their best not to take this as a lack of respect for divorced individuals. 
	% in the When outlining marital status taxing, we can see "Calculation of tax for Married people", "Calculation of tax for Single people", but the word 'divorced' is not capitalised, typo or lack of respect for divorced?  
\end{itemize}

% Non-Functional Requirements
% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional-requirements}
It is understood that performance testing, security and other non-functional requirements are not to be considered in the scope of testing this project; however, it would be careless for us not to mention them in a System Requirments review as they constitute an intrical part of the requirements development process. 
We would normally expect requirements on security, performance, compatibility and robustness to be elicited clearly in a separate non-functional requirements section; but, it is understood that the scope of testing of this project is restricted to the functional aspects and this may explain their absence. 
\par
That said, we identify (\RSeven:\textit{"The system must not crash if the user enters something that they are not meant to."}) as a non-functional requirement pertaining to the robustness of the application. In a more formal document, this requirement should be placed separately to functional ones.    
%
% Ignorable: 
% ----------
% What platforms must the system run on? Must the language to be used be Java, or can developer preference overtake in the matter? 
% * Non-functional requirements have not been detailed: do we expect the system to run on any platform? are there any speed / performance requirements that need to be catered for? For example, the requirements don't mention how many clients can be persisted on the app, which may imply (unlimited), but in such a case, it would be useful to reconsider the array design, as this does not provide enough flexibility going forward. 
% * Are there no security requirements? Perhaps the ability to allow locking the app with an app is desirable? After all, the software does hold people's tax codes, rates...

% Key term definitions
% ----------------------------------------------
\subsection{Key term definitions}
\label{sec:key-term-definitions}
The requirements are missing some of the key sections required by an SRS document.
For instance, we note the absence of a "Definitions" section outlining the meaning to be understood from the key terms used in the requirements.
It would be useful to point out that terms "will", "should", "must", and "may" conform to a predefined standard definition (e.g. IEEE Std 610.12-1990) in order to ascertain their priorities relative to each other and avoid confusion in their interpretation. 
The importance of this should not be understated seeing as it is quite likely the audience span of this document will include non-native english speakers. 
\par
Further to this, we request explicitly defining the below key words which  appear to have been used interchangeably:  

%TODO: fix the R5 collated with interchangeably - is there another way? 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Client, customer and person. Client is used in requirements (\ROne, \RTwo, \RFive), customer in (\RTwo, \RThree, \RFour, \RFive) and person in all \REight \space requirements. \RFive \space interchangeably employs customer and client in the same sentence. 
	\item System and application. System is used in (\RTwo, \RSix, \RSeven) while application is used in (\ROne, \RFour, \RFive).
\end{itemize}

We assume through contextual understanding that they refer to the same entity, however we do request this be confirmed to us in a "Definitions" section preferably in a more formal document.
\par

% It is good that the present requirements limit the key terms used to a subset of well-known ones (will, may, should, must) are used. This reduces the risk of vagueness emanating from (english understanding).

% DEFECTS and VAGUENESS in requirements 
% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Defects and Vaguenesses}

In this section we address imprecise requirements and what we believe to be defects in the requirements. The provided requirements have been labelled (see Appendix \ref{app:labelled-requirements}) to improve readability and accessibility of the report. 

% [1] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The application must enable the storage of client’s personal details including [R1]}
The term storage is vague in that it does not specify what type of storage the details are meant to be stored in. The storage could be permanent (e.g. database, file on system) or in-memory surviving only until the next application launch. 
\par
If persistent storage is to be used, then some more details on the how this storage should behave, how robust, portable, responsive it should be would be needed. 
\par
For our testing purposes, it has been assumed that the storage of the details need only be in-memory while the application is running; as such, no testing has been done on permanent-storage.

% [2] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The software should issue each customer a numeric identifier [R2]}
This requirement was found to be clear and unambiguous. 
Minor: the usage of the word 'die' did not seem entirely appropriate, even if quoted; however, software does tend to use questionable wordage (think of the POSIX function kill), so this is a non-issue.  

% [3] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The PTMA should enable customer details to be updated [R3]}
This requirement was found to be clear and unambiguous at first read. 
However, after noting that the implementation contains sizeable chunks of code pertaining to client updates (four menu commands each with its own method definiton), we - as testers - wonder if this is a lack of specificity from the requirements perspective or going over the requirements from the developers. 
\par
Either case, it is curious why it isn't made possible to update the salary field with one command as is the case for first-name, last-name and tax-code.  
\par
Also, this requirement can be improved by specifying that customer IDs should not be updatable to avoid any possible confusion during implementation. 

% [4] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The application should be able to print lists of customer information [R4]}
% with users being able to select blocks of customers to be printed based on their unique identifiers.}
This requirement was found to be clear and unambiguous. 
It appears to allow developers flexibility in implementing how different blocks of IDs can be input by the user. This flexibility in the requirement is needed seeing as (\RFour) has strong dependency on the choice of identifiers used in (\RTwo). If non-integer identifiers were used in \RTwo \space then printing blocks of users may have to be done using comma-separated input from the user. 

% [5] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The application will calculate the tax amount to be paid by each client [R5]} 
% and display this amount along with the other customer details. The amount of the tax is based on their taxcode and their current salary according to the rules below.}
This requirement was found to be clear and unambiguous. 
However, it remains unclear why it was separated from (R8.x) the tax rules, seems like they could have been structured to follow each other. 

% [6] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The system must include a simple 'help' system that lists all commands [R6]}

This requirement was found to be clear and unambiguous, assuming system \& application refer to the same thing (see Section \ref{sec:key-term-definitions}). 

% [7] -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{The system must not crash if the user enters something that they are not meant to [R7]}
Assuming system refers to the application, the requirement is clear. 
This requirement relates to the application's robustness and should, in a more formal document, be placed in the non-functional requirements section along with other requirements relating to performance, robustness, security (see Section \ref{sec:non-functional-requirements}).

% --------------------------------------
% MISSING REQUIREMENTS ? 
% --------------------------------------
\subsection{Missing requirements}

% Delete clients. 
There is no requirement about the user's ability to delete customers from storage. This is tacitly mentioned as part of the second requirements relating to ID uniqueness. We believe it is then an oversight on the requirements writers. 
\par
% Show ID of clients. 
Requirement \RFour \space points to the need for allowing users to see customers based on their IDs. However, there is no reference to how the application-generated IDs are presented to the user. This was found to be an issue during exploratory testing, and was sourced back to both a defect in the implementation and absence in the requirements. 
\par
% Edge case: Negative salaries. 
Is it implicity that negative salaries are not a thing? How does the code deal with that? 
\par
% Edge case: taxcode with duplicate tax letters
The requirement does not specify the application's behaviour for the case when duplicates of the same letter are found in the tax code. We would expect the tax code parser to complain and specify this as invalid, however others may interpret "DD1000" to be apply the Divorced taxing twice.
