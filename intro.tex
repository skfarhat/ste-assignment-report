\section*{Introduction}

This document presents a report detailing our observations and notes from testing the TaxCalc application, starting from the requirements-read and ending with code-tests and test environments.
\par
The first section restates each of the requirements as they have been understood while highlighting possible and definite defects in the requirements. The section ends with a list of assumptions that have been made during testing either due to defective or missing requirements. 
\par
The second section examines the code structure and its testability, detailing changes that were believed to be necessary for our test procedures. 
While the motivation behind the changes is fully outlined, the need for them may not be fully appreciated until the reader gained an in-depth understanding of the code-structure, the test frameworks employed and the limitations of each. 
\par
The third section outlines the test methods used, the reasoning behind several of the decisions made when testing, as well as the test tools employed to aid in testing. This section ends by categorising defects found during testing by severity and providing recommendations on how to fix those.
