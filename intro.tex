\section*{Introduction}

% First: Requirements
We will begin this report discussing each of the present requirements as they have been understood, (pointing out) defective requirements or requirements that we believe to be missing and finally stating assumptions we have made in our development about incomplete, vague, missing or defective requirements. 
\par

% Code structure & code changes
Following this, we examine the code structure and its testability, detailing changes we believe to be necessary for our test procedures. 
While the motivation behind the changes is fully outlined, the need for them may not be fully appreciated until the reader gained an in-depth understanding of the code-structure, the test frameworks employed and the limitations of each. 
\par

% Test implementation 
Later on, we go through the test implementation delineating the different test components, their respective targets and how they all tie together
\par

% List of defects
Finally, we outline the list of defects that have been found in our testing, each with the component it affected, the current test that catches catches the defect, assigning each a severity and providing a recommendation for fixing.
