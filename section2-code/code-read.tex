\subsection{Code Read}
% Detail what notes were taken when reading the code and what was noticed from afar
% We should say that reading the code is not great in that it usually focuses our testing on some things and push us not to test, things that 
% we expect to be correct (given we know the implementation). As such, it is always better to try and make no assumptions about the contents 
% of the code when writing the tests. 

% DEFECT: There's somewhat of an assumption being made that a users salary always fits in Integer. What if they earned more than 2^31 - 1 ?
