## Fundamentals of Testing 

What is Testing? 

Establishing that a software does what it is meant to do.
Detecting specification errors. 

Testing objectives: 

* Detect defects
* Demonstrate that the software is fit for purpose 
* Software meets specific requirements

Testing principles: 

1. Can't prove absence of defects
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible
	* Get biggest bang for buck, so we need to think about the test inputs we are using. 
3. Early testing 
	* the longer we wait the more it costs (there's a graph for this)
	* aim is to detect as early as possible
4. Defect clustering
	* small number of modules tend to have the most defects. 
	* focus the efforts where they are most needed 
5. Pesticide Paradox 
	* Defects hide where they cannot be found
	* same tests won't find new errors. 
6. Absence of Errors Fallacy. 
	* if software does not have defects but does not meet requirements then wtf are we doing.
