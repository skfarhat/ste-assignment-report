\subsection{Exploratory Testing}
% TODO: detail the package / directory structure and the logic behind it. 
% TODO: mention the TaxEngine exception we created. Why its runtime exception and why its useful. 

Found that the application does not provide the IDs for the clients  it has created, so the user is left to guess or has to look at the source code to understand that the IDs generated are incremental starting from 1. 

* we notice the table is not very well formatted, the last line's '|' is not properly aligned with the rest. This is very difficult to detect in testing, and one would have to be looking for it to find it, really. For a more flexible implementation we suggest using an existing library to print tables on the command line in java such as j-text-utils. 

* it prints out "Customer deleted when doing an update, or something similar".
