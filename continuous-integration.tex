\subsection{Continuous Integration}
% Continuous integration is a practice in software development to continuously combine all developers’ changes into the main repository several times per day. Doing so means each developer has a near- latest copy of the code before making changes hence reducing the effort required to do ”System Inte- gration” near the end of the project. In doing continuous integration, each code change will undergo a series of build checks, suite tests and code quality checks to ensure quality standards are met. Recommended tool: Jenkins
